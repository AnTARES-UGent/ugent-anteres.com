# Deployment

The process of wrapping a lightweight server like Flask with a more robust, enterprise-grade server is commonly referred to as "deploying with a production server" or "server deployment". In the Python web ecosystem, this typically involves using a WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) server that acts as an intermediary between the Flask application and the internet.

Here's a more detailed explanation:

## Development Server
Flask comes with a built-in server, which is a lightweight WSGI server that is easy to use during development. However, it isn't designed to handle production traffic—it’s not as stable, secure, or scalable as other servers.

## Production Server
For production, you would typically wrap your Flask app with a server that is designed to be used in a production environment. Common choices for WSGI servers in Python are Gunicorn, uWSGI, and mod_wsgi (for Apache).

## Reverse Proxy
In addition, a production deployment often uses a reverse proxy server in front of the WSGI server. This server (commonly Nginx or Apache) can handle client requests, manage load balancing, support SSL/TLS, and serve static files efficiently, among other things. The WSGI server only runs the Python application.

## Deployment Process
1. Write your Flask application as you normally would.
2. Choose a WSGI HTTP server like Gunicorn or uWSGI for deploying your application.
3. Set up a reverse proxy server (Nginx/Apache) that will receive client requests and pass them to the WSGI server.
4. Configure the reverse proxy to handle static files and pass other requests to the WSGI server.
5. Start the WSGI server and have it run your Flask application.
6. Ensure that the reverse proxy server is properly configured to handle client connections and to communicate with your WSGI server.

This multi-tiered setup (Flask app, WSGI server, and reverse proxy) ensures that the production environment is secure, efficient, and scalable. It separates concerns, allows for better handling of static and dynamic content, provides SSL termination, and more.
